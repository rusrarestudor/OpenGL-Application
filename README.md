# OpenGL-Application

The subject of the project consists in the photorealistic presentation of 3D objects using OpenGL library. The user directly manipulates by mouse and keyboard inputs the scene of objects.
    - visualization of the scene: scaling, translation, rotation, camera movement
    - using keyboard and mouse
    - using animation
    - specification of light sources (minimum two different lights)
    - viewing solid, wireframe objects, polygonal and smooth surfaces
    - texture mapping and materials
    - textures quality and level of detail
    - textures mapping on objects
    - exemplify shadow computation
    - exemplify animation of object components
    - photo-realism, scene complexity, detailed modeling, algorithms development and implementation (objects generation, collision detection, shadow generation, fog, rain, wind), animation quality, different types of light sources (global, local, spotlights)
